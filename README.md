# React JS for beginners

This project is for learning react js & keeping track of everything that I do while learning.

##Getting Started

React is a JS library for building view interfaces facebook. It's not MVC it is just view part of MVC.

##Awesome features of react 

1. You don't directly manipulate DOM. It has something called virtual DOM which has same structure(Tree structure) like DOM but it is not like  DOM. It is just collection of objects. You manipulate virtual DOM & react is intelligent enough to compare changes & pass it to DOM(Actually it has two copy of virtual DOM previous & current it compares that & apply only the difference to Real DOM).

2. React is component based which make it readable, easy to maintain & debug.

##How to start

To start coding in react is fairly simple like other frameworks just include some library & you are good to go.

**This is not the recommended way but we'll get into that later**
